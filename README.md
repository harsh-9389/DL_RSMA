## Introduction

This project contains the code used for the research paper titled "Deep Learning-Based Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Tera-Hertz Massive MIMO". The paper explores the application of deep learning techniques to optimize rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in Tera-Hertz (THz) massive MIMO systems with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS).

## Features

- Implementation of deep learning models for RSMA.
- Simulation scripts for THz massive MIMO systems.
- Configuration files for RIS setups.
- Performance evaluation metrics and visualization tools.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harsh-9389/DL_RSMA.git
   cd DL_RSMA
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the simulations and deep learning models, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DL_RSMA
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebooks for different experiments. For example:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/experiment1.ipynb
   ```

3. For running Python scripts directly:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```
